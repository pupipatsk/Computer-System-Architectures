# Activity I â€“ Instruction Set and Compiler

## Exercise 1 - Instruction Analysis
This exercise will familiarize you  with several aspects of the instruction set and the fundamentals of the compiler. Given max.c (below), please use `gcc -S max.c` to compile the code into assembly code. (The result will be in max.s.) From the result, answer the following questions.

```c
// max.c
int max1(int a, int b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}

int max2(int a, int b) {
    int isaGTB = a > b;
    int max;
    if (isaGTB) {
        max = a;
    } else {
        max = b;
    }
    return max;
}
```

What does the code hint about the kind of instruction set? (e.g. Accumulator, Register Memory, Memory Memory, Register Register) Please justify your answer.

> **Answer**:\
> Register-Register (Load-Store) instruction set architecture.
> - Register-Register architectures operate primarily by loading values from memory into registers, performing operations on those registers, and then storing the results back into memory.
> - In the assembly code, we can see multiple load (ldr) and store (str) instructions. For example, the variables w0, w1, etc., are being loaded from memory into registers and stored back into memory. This is a characteristic of the load-store architecture.

Can you tell whether the architecture is either Restricted Alignment or Unrestricted Alignment? Please explain how you come up with your answer.

> **Answer**:\
> The architecture seems to be Restricted Alignment. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the code aligns the stack pointer with a multiple of 16 bytes using sub sp, sp, #16 before any operations. Restricted Alignment architectures often require that memory accesses are aligned to specific byte boundaries (e.g., 16-byte alignment for 64-bit architectures). This alignment ensures that memory accesses are efficient and prevents potential faults.


Create a new function (e.g. testMax) to call max1. Generate new assembly code. What does the result suggest regarding the register saving (caller save vs. callee save)? Please provide your analysis.
```c
// max.c, testMax()
int testMax() {
    int result = max1(5, 10);
    return result;
}
```

> **Answer**:\
> The analysis suggests that this system follows a caller-save convention for general-purpose registers (w0, w1, etc.). This means that the caller is responsible for saving any registers that it needs to preserve across function calls. However, special registers like x29 (frame pointer) and x30 (link register) follow a callee-save convention, meaning the callee is responsible for preserving these registers' values.
> - Caller-Save Convention Observed:
>   - In the testMax function, before calling max1, the stack is adjusted, and the registers x29 (frame pointer) and x30 (link register, used to store the return address) are stored on the stack using the stp instruction. This ensures that the current state of the function can be restored after max1 is called. The fact that these registers are saved by the caller (testMax) suggests a caller-save convention.
>   - The general-purpose registers w0 and w1 are used to pass arguments to max1, and max1 places the return value in w0. These registers are not explicitly saved and restored by the callee (max1), indicating that if testMax needed to preserve the values in these registers across the function call, it would be responsible for saving them. This confirms that w0 and w1 are caller-saved registers.
> - Callee-Save Convention for Specific Registers:
>   - The registers x29 (frame pointer) and x30 (link register) are saved on the stack at the beginning of testMax and restored before returning. These are examples of callee-saved registers, meaning that functions are expected to preserve their values across calls.

How do the arguments be passed and the return value returned from a function? Please explain the code.

> **Answer**:
> - Arguments Passing:
> ```
> mov    w0, #5        ; Move the value 5 into register w0 (first argument)
> mov    w1, #10       ; Move the value 10 into register w1 (second argument)
> bl     _max1         ; Branch to the function max1
> ```
> The first two arguments are passed via the w0 and w1 registers.
> If there were additional arguments beyond what can fit in registers, they would be passed via the stack.
> - Return Value:\
> i. Return Value in Register:
> ```
> ldr    w0, [sp, #4]  ; Load the result from the stack into w0
> ```
> The return value of the function is stored in the w0 register.
> ii. Handling the Return Value:
> ```
> stur   w0, [x29, #-4]  ; Store the result of max1 in memory
> ldur   w0, [x29, #-4]  ; Load the result back into w0 (to return from testMax)
> ```
> The caller (testMax) retrieves the return value from w0 and can use or return it as necessary.

Find the part of code (snippet) that does comparison and conditional branch. Explain how it works.

> **Answer**:

If max.c is compiled with optimization turned on (using `gcc -O2 -S max.c`), what are the differences that you may observe from the result (as compared to that without optimization). Please provide your analysis

> **Answer**:

> ```
> cmp   w0, w1                ; Compare w0 (a) with w1 (b)

> ```
> Instead of using conditional branches, the compiler optimizes the comparison and selection process with the cmp and csel instructions. The csel instruction conditionally selects between two values based on the result of the comparison (cmp). This avoids branching entirely, making the code faster and reducing potential branch mispredictions.
> - No Memory Accesses: All operations are performed in registers, eliminating unnecessary memory loads and stores.
> - No Branching: The optimized code uses conditional selection instead of branching, which can reduce latency and improve performance.
> - Inlining: Functions with constant arguments are evaluated at compile time, and their results are inlined into the code.c
> ```
> //_testMax:
> mov    w0, #10  ; Move the constant value 10 into w0
> ret             ; Return the result
> ```
> The optimized version of testMax no longer calls max1. Instead, it directly returns the constant result 10. This is an example of constant folding and inlining, where the compiler evaluates the result at compile-time since it knows the values being passed to max1 are constants (5 and 10). The function becomes a simple mov and ret sequence:

Please estimate the CPU Time required by the max1 function (using the equation CPI=ICxCPIxTc). If possible, create a main function to call max1 and use the time command to measure the performance. Compare the measure to your estimation. What do you think are the factors that cause the difference? Please provide your analysis.
(You may find references online regarding the CPI of each instruction.)

Measure Actual CPU Time
```c
// max.c
#include <stdio.h>

int max1(int a, int b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}

int max2(int a, int b) {
    int isaGTB = a > b;
    int max;
    if (isaGTB) {
        max = a;
    } else {
        max = b;
    }
    return max;
}

int testMax() {
    int result = max1(5, 10);
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {  // Call max1 a billion(10^9) times
        result = max1(5, 10);
    }
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```
```
// ! gcc -O2 -o max_time max.c
// ! time ./max_time
Result: 10
./max_time  0.00s user 0.00s system 1% cpu 0.475 total
```
Time per call = 0.475 s / 10^9 calls = 0.475Â ns per call

The difference between the estimated and measured CPU time can be attributed to:
- CPU Optimizations: Pipelining, out-of-order execution, and branch prediction reduce the effective CPI.
- Efficient Execution: The optimized code benefits from advanced CPU features that minimize the time per instruction.
- Measurement Precision: The time command captures the total execution time including all overheads, but the measured time per call is still impressive due to efficient processor execution.
